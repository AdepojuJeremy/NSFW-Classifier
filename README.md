# NSFW-Classifier
An AWS Sagemaker Model developed for Nudity / NSFW Images Classification <br>


This is project done for the fullfillment of Udacity Machine Learning Engineer NanoDegree. I have build a model that classifies 
input image into five categories.
1. **Nude** 
2. **Semi Nude**
3. **Animated**
4. **Porn**
5. **Safe For Work**


#  Data Collection And Organization
The following guys had collected the data 
1. [B Praneeth 's Data](https://archive.org/details/NudeNet_classifier_dataset_v1) . He did an awesome job in collection 
of data . The data is for three classes <br>
..* Nude 
..* Sexy 
.. Safe. 
..1. But the problem is I need more categories for my problem . So I made a simple [tool](www.google.com) that is helpful for sub classifying the above Nude Images. You just keep all the training samples in one folder and run and run it in a jupyter notebook.
I classified a few thousands of these , but then i realized that it would take a while to gather huge data.
